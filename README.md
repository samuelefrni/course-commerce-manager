## Introduction

IncluDO is a startup that creates inclusive online courses, real professional training paths for migrants and disadvantaged people to include them in the world of work.

To launch his latest courses, he decides to create an e-commerce site. To do this, they entrust you with the creation of a smart contract to record sales within their site.

The project involves the creation of a smart contract in Solidity that regulates the entire sales process.

## About the project

Create a CourseCommerceManager.sol file, with the following characteristics:

1. Address of the contract owner
2. A structure containing a product address, name, and price in Ether
3. An array containing all products
4. Total number of sales recorded
5. A structure containing information about a sale, such as product purchased, purchase data, and buyer
6. An array containing all sales
7. Event to track when a new sale is added to the sales array
8. Allow the contract owner to withdraw from the contract balance
9. Add a new product available for sale
10. Return information for a specified product via its identifier
11. Allow a customer to purchase a product and record the sale
12. Return information for a specific sale via its identifier.

Next, publish the smart contract on the blockchain.

Also create a Library in Solidity that allows the following operations, and use it within the CourseCommerceManager.sol contract:

13. Return the products purchased by a specific customer in the form of a data structure
14. Calculate the amount of ether sales given a certain period of time.
